## Konstantin Gavras, M.A. 

I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [Graduate School of Economic and Social Sciences](https://gess.uni-mannheim.de/) in Political Science and research associate at the chair of Political Psychology at the University of Mannheim. 

### Research

My core research interests comprise the intersection of Social Psychology and Political Behavior, focusing on the behavioral consequences and conditions underlying the acceptance of citizenship norms. I am also interested in the latent modeling framework, natural language processing and multi-level modeling.

In my dissertation I am examining under which conditions citizenship norms have behavioral consequences. My project encompasses a reconceptualization of citizenship norms within the framework of social norms, vignette experiments in Germany and the United States to identify the relevance of normative saliency and a large-scale survey study to examine the distribution and behavioral implications of citizenship norms within the German population.

Together with my great collegues I am also working on several smaller projects including a machine learning approach to derive ideological positioning and its dependency on the political discourse based on press releases by the German political parties, and a rigorous test of the conflicting hypotheses regarding the changes in citizenship norms over one's lifespan. Additionally, I work on a project investigating the peculiarities of information search processes in the political domain based on the Attraction Search Effect.

I make use of several statistical software in my projects. I mainly work with R for multivariate analysis and Python for web based research, natural language processing and machine learning projects. Additionally, I use Stata and MPlus for specific research projects and am able to work with SPSS. I use MS Office and LaTeX as text processing and presenting tools.

### Teaching

Since August 2016 I teach undergraduate seminars in Political Sociology and Methods. I taught classes on political ideologies and their impact on attitudes and behavior, and gave a statistical course in multi-level modeling. In the upcoming semester, I will teach a seminar on survey experiments in Political Science.

My teaching for the undergraduate seminar "Ideologien, Einstellungssysteme und ihre politischen Konsequenzen" in Autumn 2016 was awarded with the GESS Teaching Award 2017.

### CorrelAid

Since early 2015 I am member of [CorrelAid](https://correlaid.org/en/), a network of young data analysts who seek to change civic society with a more inclusive, integrated and innovative approach to data analysis. The network takes a leading role in pro-bono data analysis and consultation for social organizations within Germany. CorrelAid builds on three pillars: It takes a pioneer role in analytics consulting for Non-Profit-Organizations. It connects young, driven data scientists and offers them the possibility to apply and develop their skills on real world problems. And it starts a dialogue on the potential of data and analytics for civic society.

With the establishment of CorrelAid, I became a member of our pilot project with the Boy Scouts of Northern Germany and carried out our project with the Assocation of Debatting Unions at Universities [(VDCH)](http://www.vdch.de/) and the German Debating Union [(DDG)](http://deutsche-debattiergesellschaft.de/) as team leader. At the moment I am building a local chapter at the University of Mannheim in which CorrelAid provides the students with workshops and collaborative projects throughout the Rhine Neckar region.
