## Konstantin Gavras, M.A. 

I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [Graduate School of Economic and Social Sciences](https://gess.uni-mannheim.de/) in Political Science and research associate at the chair of Political Psychology at the University of Mannheim. 

### Research

My core research interests comprise the intersection of Social Psychology and Political Behavior, focusing on the behavioral consequences and conditions underlying the acceptance of citizenship norms. I am also interested in the latent modeling framework with regard to ideological scaling, natural language processing and multi-level modeling.

In my dissertation I am examining the conditions under which citizenship norms have behavioral consequences. My project encompasses a reconceptualization of citizenship norms within the framework of social norms, vignette experiments in Germany and the United States to identify the relevance of normative saliency and a large-scale survey study to examine the distribution and behavioral implications of citizenship norms within the German population.
