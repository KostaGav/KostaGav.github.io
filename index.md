## Konstantin Gavras, M.A. 

I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [Graduate School of Economic and Social Sciences](https://gess.uni-mannheim.de/) in Political Science, research associate at the [Chair of Political Psychology](http://lspwpp.sowi.uni-mannheim.de/english/team/researchers_and_assistant_lecturers/Konstantin%20Gavras/) at the University of Mannheim and doctoral researcher for the MZES project "[Fighting together, moving apart? European common defence and shared security in an age of Brexit and Trump](https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/d7/en/projects/fighting-together-moving-apart-european-common-defence-and-shared-security-in-an-age-of-brexit-and-trump)" funded by the VW-Stiftung. 

### Research

My core research interests comprise the intersection of Social Psychology and Political Behavior, focusing on the behavioral consequences and conditions underlying political attitudes regarding both domestic and foreign policies. I am also interested in the determinants of political attitudes and their impact on voting behavior and the mechanisms of elite-media-public political communication. Methodologically, I employ  natural language processing, multi-level modeling, quantitative text analysis and latent modeling framework,.

In my dissertation, I am examining political communication in multi-level systems with conflicting elite actors. Examplified by the Common Security and Defense Policy of the European Union, I show that a Europeanization of policy-making also has attitudinal and communicative consequences. Analyzing both text and survey data from all over Europe, I aim to provide a comprehensive picture of political communication in this multi-level system. 

Together with my great collegues I am also working on several smaller projects including a machine learning approach to derive ideological positioning and its dependency on the political discourse based on press releases by the German political parties, and a rigorous test of the conflicting hypotheses regarding the changes in citizenship norms over one's lifespan. I am involved in a project exmaining the persistence of the winner-loser effects after elections. Additionally, I work on a project investigating the peculiarities of information search processes in the political domain based on the Attraction Search Effect.

I make use of several statistical software in my projects. I mainly work with R for multivariate analysis and web scraping as well as Python for natural language processing and machine learning projects. Additionally, I use Stata and MPlus for specific research projects and am able to work with SPSS. I use MS Office and LaTeX as text processing and presenting tools.

### Teaching

Since August 2016 I teach undergraduate seminars in Political Sociology and Quantitative Methods. I taught classes on political ideologies and their impact on attitudes and behavior, a reading seminar on the classics of political attitude and voting research, and gave statistical courses in multi-level modeling and survey experiments. In Autumn 2018, I also received the Baden-Württemberg Zertifikat für Hochschuldidaktik.

My teaching for the undergraduate seminar "Ideologien, Einstellungssysteme und ihre politischen Konsequenzen" in Autumn 2016 was awarded with the GESS Teaching Award 2017.

### CorrelAid

Since early 2015 I am member of [CorrelAid](https://correlaid.org/en/), a network of young data analysts who seek to change civic society with a more inclusive, integrated and innovative approach to data analysis. The network takes a leading role in pro-bono data analysis and consultation for social organizations within Germany. CorrelAid builds on three pillars: It takes a pioneer role in analytics consulting for Non-Profit-Organizations. It connects young, driven data scientists and offers them the possibility to apply and develop their skills on real world problems. And it starts a dialogue on the potential of data and analytics for civic society.

With the establishment of CorrelAid, I became a member of our pilot project with the Boy Scouts of Northern Germany and carried out our project with the Assocation of Debatting Unions at Universities [(VDCH)](http://www.vdch.de/) and the German Debating Union [(DDG)](http://deutsche-debattiergesellschaft.de/) as team leader. At the moment I am building a local chapter at the University of Mannheim in which CorrelAid provides the students with workshops and collaborative projects throughout the Rhine Neckar region.
