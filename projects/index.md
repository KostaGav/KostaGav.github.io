### Scraping and Pre-Processing Press Releases from Political Parties using Python

Press releases have been just recently been discovered as important source of information to determine the ideological positions of political parties and candidates. However, this data is often not preprocessed adequately and has to be extracted by researchers from the respective homepages of the political parties. In order to train my Python skills, I decided to write a Python script that automatically scrapes all press releases from the six big political parties in the German Bundestag. However, due to the particularities in the respective homepages (different relative paths, HTML and JavaScripted homepages), it is not possible to create a script running over all homepages at once. Since the press releases are still quite messy after scraping them, I supplement my code with some pre-processing steps in Python and create easy-to-use tsv-files from the scraped and pre-processed press releases.

Privacy disclaimer: Do not scrape homepages when you are unsure whether the Terms of Service do not provide permission to extract information automatically. The author does not take any responsibilities when applying the code to any non-personal homepages.
